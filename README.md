# A rails app to demonstrate how to use devise, omniauth and backbonejs 

Workflow:

1. Users are required to sign in with their twitter accounts
2. Once the user has authorized the app(registered as stock_dashboard_sc) to use its twitter account, the user is able to use the app
3. The user enters a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, FB, TWTR)  
4. The stock quotes are displayed in real time
5. It also demonstrates how to display the last 15 tweets that mentioned the symbol (e.g., $AAPL, $FB, $TWTR) in real time
